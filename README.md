The main aim of this project is to make attendance using face detection and recognition, I've created this project  for the Microsoft Engage 2022 program. This program makes CSV files of present attendees automatically After successful face detection and recognition. Also, It will make a CSV file for registered student's detailed information.

I made this program using these libraries. OpenCV, Pandas, tkinter, Numpy, OS.

When you run this project you will see the simple GUI of this Attendance System, for that I've created two sections in that first for registering yourself for that enter your registration number, name, image.

After that click on save profile by entering your password if you have created otherwise you can create on any moment, now you can take your attendance by clicking on take attendance, and now a video frame has taken your video and you can see that you are recognized if u have earlier saved your profile successfully and now you can exit this frame by clicking q (also for saving your attendance) in csv file.
